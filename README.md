Choice of PRIME

PRIME is the prime number, which denotes the field that all VC computations play. In order to compute efficiently, we'd better nicely choose PRIME as follows:
1. In order to find the (4N)th root of unity efficiently, I pick PRIME as a prime number of form 4Nk+1, in which k is a prime number as well.
2. For the use of commitment, PRIME^2 + 1 (= GSIZE) should be a prime number as well. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)


The Use of ROU

ROU stores the cyclic group generated by a 4N-th root of unity.
1. This is for FFT
